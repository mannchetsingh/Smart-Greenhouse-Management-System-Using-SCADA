# Smart-Greenhouse-Management-System-Using-SCADA

For my recent project, I spearheaded the development of a Smart Greenhouse Management System using SCADA on LABVIEW. The system integrates various components including a DC motor, L298N motor driver, peristaltic pump, Arduino Uno, LM35 temperature sensor, and a soil moisture sensor. We designed a Virtual Instrument (VI) on LabVIEW software where the front panel allows control of the motor's direction and speed, as well as monitoring and managing the soil moisture levels. This innovative approach ensures that our system can adapt to changing environmental conditions in real-time, enhancing the efficiency of greenhouse management.

The system's functionality is comprehensive, featuring real-time temperature monitoring through an LM35 sensor displayed on the front panel. If the temperature exceeds a predefined threshold, a red LED activates, signaling the fan to start. The fan's speed and direction are controlled via the front panel, ensuring precise environmental control within the greenhouse. Additionally, the soil moisture level is continuously monitored, with a green LED indicating optimal levels. When the moisture falls below a critical level, a red LED lights up, triggering the pump to water the crops. The pump's flow rate and direction are also adjustable via the front panel, allowing for tailored irrigation solutions.

This project showcases the practical application of SCADA systems in agriculture, demonstrating the potential for advanced sensor technology and automation to revolutionize greenhouse management. By providing real-time data and automated responses, our system significantly reduces the need for manual intervention, thereby increasing efficiency and productivity. This project highlights the importance of integrating advanced control systems in agricultural practices to achieve sustainable and optimized crop production.
